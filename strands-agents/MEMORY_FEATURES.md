# Memory-Enabled Strands Agent Features

## üß† Memory Integration with Mem0

### Core Memory Features

1. **Persistent Memory**: Remembers user information across sessions
2. **Personalized Responses**: Adapts responses based on user history
3. **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation context and continuity
4. **User Preferences**: Learns and stores user likes, dislikes, and preferences
5. **Semantic Search**: Finds relevant memories using intelligent search

### Memory Tools Available

#### `search_memory(query, user_id)`
- Searches through user's stored memories
- Uses semantic similarity for intelligent retrieval
- Returns relevant past conversations and information

#### `save_memory(content, user_id)`
- Stores important information to user's memory
- Automatically extracts key details from conversations
- Maintains persistent storage across sessions

#### `get_user_preferences(user_id)`
- Retrieves user preferences and personal information
- Focuses on likes, dislikes, favorites, and personal details
- Enables personalized recommendations

#### `personalized_greeting(user_id)`
- Generates personalized greetings based on memory
- References user's name and interests when available
- Creates continuity in conversations

## üí° Usage Examples

### Basic Memory Interaction
```
User: "Hi, my name is Alice and I love machine learning"
Agent: "Nice to meet you, Alice! I'll remember that you love machine learning. How can I help you today?"

User: "What do you remember about me?"
Agent: "I remember that your name is Alice and you love machine learning. Is there anything specific about ML you'd like to discuss?"
```

### Personalized Responses
```
User: "Recommend some tools for my projects"
Agent: "Based on your interest in machine learning, I'd recommend tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn. Would you like specific recommendations for any particular type of ML project?"
```

### Memory Search
```
User: "What did we discuss about Python last week?"
Agent: [Searches memory for Python-related conversations and provides relevant context]
```
